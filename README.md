# Task-2-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report 

In this EDA report, we explored the provided dataset and revealed three valuable insights. We observed the distribution of examples across different classes, identified the top frequent n-grams, and analyzed the lengths of examples in words and letters. This EDA process provides a foundation for understanding the data better, guiding further analysis, and developing suitable models based on the dataset's characteristics. Further analysis and modeling can be performed based on the insights obtained in this report.
